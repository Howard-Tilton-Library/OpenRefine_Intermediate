2587790	Freedom of Expression :Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property /produced by Kembrew McLeod and Jeremy Smith.[electronic resource]	Resistance & repression in the age of intellectual property	[San Francisco, California, USA] :Kanopy Streaming,2014.;[Northamton, Massachusetts] :Media Education Foundation,2007.	1 online resource (1 video file, 61 min.)		"In 1998, university professor Kembrew McLeod trademarked the phrase ""freedom of expression"" - a startling comment on the way that intellectual property law restricts creativity and expression of ideas. This provocative and amusing documentary explores the battles being waged in courts, classrooms, museums, film studios, and the Internet over control of our cultural commons. Based on McLeod's award-winning book of the same title, Freedom of Expression charts the many successful attempts to push back this assault by overzealous copyright holders. Freedom of Expression is an essential tool for educators, activists, filmmakers, students, artists, librarians, and more."

After the massive earthquake that struck in January 2010, killing an estimated 250,000 and leaving 1.2 million homeless, a flood of aid and agencies arrived at Haiti's door. Some had an agenda to help, others had an agenda to protect their own assets and interests. Three years later, what state has this aid left the Haitian people in? Peck's powerful and thorough investigative film shows all the levels at which aid, NGOs and political ploys have left Haiti in turmoil. He unveils the true face of international aid as a failure full of organizational ineptitude, broken promises and hidden agendas. This must-see film paints a vivid picture that the ""aid"" of foreign powers is more realistically an occupation."

'The Price of Kings: Oscar Arias' explores the legacy of this man: the former President of Costa Rica and lone leader without an army who had the courage to forge peace with his neighbors against the will of [the] U.S. President, at risk to his own life and the impoverishment of his people. Arias' diplomacy and leadership brought an end to the bloodshed, for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize and the adoration of his people ...

After getting drafted into the Czech army during WWI, Schweik becomes an assistant to high-ranking military officials, and unwittingly wreaks havoc on the leaders of the 91st infantry.

Though more than 100 years have passed since the doors to higher education opened for Black women, their numbers as faculty members are woefully low and for many still, the image of Black women as intellectuals is incomprehensible. And while overtly expressed racism, sexism and discrimination have declined, their presence is often still often unacknowledged.

Bonus features on disc 3 include French and American movie trailers, posters of the film, stills, biography of Claude Lanzmann, and discussion between Cladue Lanzmann and Serge Klasfeld.	"In 1975, in Rome, Claude Lanzmann filmed a series of interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last President of the Jewish Council in the Theresienstadtghetto in Czechoslovakia, the only ""Elder of the Jews"" (according to Nazi terminology) not to have been killed during the war. A rabbi in Vienna, following the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, Murmelstein fought bitterly with Adolf Eichmann, week after week for seven years, managing to help around 121,000 Jews leave the country, and preventing the liquidation of the ghetto. 2012. Claude Lanzmann, at 87 - without masking anything of the passage of time on men, but showing the incredible permanence of the locations involved - exhumes these interviews shot in Rome, returning to Theresienstadt, the town ""given to the Jews by Hitler"", a so-called model ghetto, but a ghetto of deceit chosen by Adolf Eichmann to dupe the world. We discover the extraordinary personality of Benjamin Murmelstein: a man blessed with a dazzling intelligence and a true courage, which, along with an unrivaled memory, makes him a wonderfully wry, sardonic and authentic storyteller. Through these three periods, from Nisko in Poland to Theresienstadt, and from Vienna to Rome, the film provides an unprecedented insight into the genesis of the Final Solution. It reveals the true face of Eichmann, and exposes without artifice the savage contradictions of the Jewish Councils."

A film about Albie Sachs, a lawyer, writer, art lover and freedom fighter, set against the dramatic events leading to the overthrow of the apartheid regime in South Africa.

For his actions as a lawyer, he was imprisoned in solitary confinement in Cape Town, tortured through sleep deprivation, and forced into exile. In 1988 he was blown up by a car bomb set by South African security forces in Maputo, Mozambique, which cost him his right arm and the sight of one eye, but miraculously he survived, and after a long year of rehabilitation in England, he recovered. Returning to South Africa following the release of Nelson Mandela, Albie helped write the new Constitution and was then appointed as one of the first 11 judges to the new Constitutional Court, which for the past 20 years has been insuring that the rights of all South Africans are afforded protection.

"""The Mask You Live In follows boys and young men as they struggle to stay true to themselves while negotiating America's narrow definition of masculinity. Pressured by the media, their peer group, and even the adults in their lives, our protagonists confront messages encouraging them to disconnect from their emotions, devalue authentic friendships, objectify and degrade women, and resolve conflicts through violence. These gender stereotypes interconnect with race, class and circumstance, creating a maze of identity issues boys and young men must navigate to become 'real' men. Experts in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, sports, education, and media also weigh in, offering empirical evidence of the 'boy crisis' and tactics to combat it. The Mask You Live In ultimately illustrates how we, as a society, can raise a healthier generation of boys and young men""--Representation Project Website."

"""The Hebrews is an independent project for documenting Hebrew culture, containing films, video talks and books. So far 8 feature-length documentary films have been released, 2 books have been published, and dozens of talks with experts and commentators have been recorded."";Full screen 1.33:1."	DVD 1. Leʼah Goldberg ba-ḥamishah batim -- 52 minutes -- Lea Goldberg was a prolific Hebrew author, poet, playwright, literary translator and researcher of literature. Her writings are considered classics of Israeli literature. Even today, Lea Goldberg is still an enigmatic figure--she is Israel's most beloved poet, a powerful woman, who lived with her mother and never married, a woman who invented herself from the ashes of World War I though her magical poetry. The film is a cinematic fantasy in five acts, bringing together animation, after-effects, archives, still photos, original music and interviews to celebrate the author's fascinating story.;DVD 2. ha-Meʻorer Y.Ḥ. Brener -- 56 minutes -- In 1921, six dead bodies were found near the Red House between Tel Aviv and Jaffa. One was the body of Y.H. Brenner, a brilliant author, sharp critic of his generation, a man of ambiguous sexuality and prophetic characteristics. He was well known throughout the Jewish world. An official report, written but sealed shortly after these events, was discovered only recently. It is featured in this film, along with animated sequences by David Polonsky (Waltz with Bashir), conversations with Brenner scholars, rare period stills, and selections from his works.;DVD 3. Melekh ha-Yehudim : Ḥ. N. Byaliḳ. -- 57 minutes -- Chaim Nachman Bialik was perhaps the most beloved Jew of his time. One hundred thousand people attended his funeral in 1934 in Tel Aviv. He became the Zionist national poet at the age of 30. Who was this man, also known as the King of the Jews? Using specially designed animation, narration by Chaim Topol (Fiddler on the Roof), and early 20th century music sung by Ninette, Israel's most popular singer, the film unveils the story of this once famous and beloved man who laid the foundation for Israeli culture.;DVD 4. Ishah peshuṭah : Zelda -- 55 minutes -- She published her first book of poetry at the age of 53 and became a prominent figure in the field of Hebrew literature. Niece of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Zelda lived alone in Jerusalem, writing poems on scraps of paper, surrounded by a small court of lovers and admirers. Through never-before-seen archival footage and meetings with her lovers and friends (Amos, Chava Alberstein), the film gently sketches a portrait of the first religious female poet.;DVD 5. 7 ha-selilim shel Yonah Ṿalakh -- 56 minutes -- More than 25 years after the death of poet Yona Wallach, seven recorded tapes from her last interview were discovered. In these tapes, Wallach opens up about her life journey: her attraction to madness, her experimentation with drugs, her relationship with god and the dangers of writing. The film weaves her testimony with interviews, rare archival footage, poems and animation that revive Wallach's thoughts, images and visions.;DVD 6. Shir yedidot : R. Daṿid Buzaglo -- 64 minutes -- Documentary about the life of popular Sephardi cantor and hymnist Rabbi David Buzaglo, who left Morocco for Israel in 1965, where he revived the tradition of Western liturgical music. Includes interviews with family, friends, colleagues, students, and scholars of North African Jewry and liturgical music. Features hymns written by Buzaglo performed by him and others, and documentary clips from Casablanca (in black and white) and 1960s-1970s Israel.;DVD 7. ha-ʻAlmah Bluvshṭain Raḥel -- 58 minutes -- Documentary about the life of Hebrew poet Rachel Bluwstein, known simply as Rachel, considered a national poet of Israel. Includes interviews with literary researchers, poets, historians, and biographers.;DVD 8. ha-ʻOrev : Ṿladimir Zeʼev Z'aboṭinsḳi -- 60 minutes -- Ze'ev Vladimir Jabotinsky? Most people know only that he was the father of Herut movement, a revisionist. And who knows what revisionism really means? A few people know that he translated Edgar Allan Poe's Annabel Lee; even fewer read his historical novel, Samson. The Raven tries to fathom Jabotinsky's deceptive character. The film follows his conflicted, controversial character, the meaningful choices, desires and abilities that eventually led him to end his life prematurely, but left a huge mark on Zionism and Israel.

On May 17, 1968, nine Catholic activists entered a Selective Service office in suburban Catonsville, Maryland, dragged stacks of Draft Board records out into the parking lot, and set them on fire with homemade napalm. They then prayed, and waited to be arrested. In doing so, they kindled a wave of similar protests against the Vietnam War across the country that swept up dozens of participants and inspired thousands, and then millions. HIT & STAY, a new documentary film by Joe Tropea and Skizz Cyzyk tells the story of the Nine and those who joined them in protesting the war. The Catonsville Nine action had been preceded by a quartet of activists--including Catonsville Nine participant, Father Philip Berrigan--splashing blood on draft files in nearby Baltimore. But it was Catonsville that galvanized the nonviolent antiwar resistance away from protest marches and toward direct actions by ordinary citizens against draft boards. This new form of protest quickly spread to similar actions in Washington, D.C., New York, Milwaukee, and all across the country, drawing the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as the increasingly antiwar American public. Through interviews with many of the participants (as well as observers ranging from linguist political critic Noam Chomsky to historian Howard Zinn), HIT & STAY explores the early actions, the activists going to prison or going underground, the FBI's pushback against the movement, the escalating scale and stakes, and the ultimate victory of the protesters in the trial of the Camden 28.

"""Director Richard Robinson (The Beekeepers) retraces Rothstein's steps by interviewing descendants of the mountain people and beautifully weaving them together with a 1964 audio interview of Rothstein, archival newsreel footage, and clips from the specious documentary ""Hollow Folk.""  During the course of his research, Robinson discovered evidence that Rothstein's images were not pure documentation. Instead, they were often staged for the camera. Digging beneath the official story, the film unearths an unsettling link between propaganda and documentary, and raises troubling questions about the photographer's complicity in the displacement of thousands of people for ""progress.""  Robinson's most chilling discovery, though, is the forced institutionalization and sterilization of mountain residents as part of a eugenics program where over 8,000 individuals were sterilized. This fascinating film challenges the viewer to consider the complexity behind images that are viewed as historical truth. "" -- Cinema Guild Web site."

In the last years of World War II, a group of North African soldiers, largely Muslims, enlist to free France--a country they consider their motherland, even though they've never set foot in it--from the Nazis. The story is told through four characters: Abdelkader, a corporal who hopes to be promoted to sergeant; Messaoud, an ace marksman who fall in love with a beautiful Frenchwoman; Yassir, a Berber peasant who needs the money to marry off his younger brother; and Saïd, who leaves as his own father did in WWI, because he feels it's his duty. They give their all, despite getting little respect or recognition, and suffering the privations of those habitually discriminated against. These 'native' soldiers selflessly fought for a France they had never seen, and the film records their past heroics to give dignity to the generations of today and the future.

Things take a disastrous turn after one of Marie's ""customers"" dies, and her husband turns her over to the authorities. Inspired by the life of Marie-Louise Girard, who was executed in 1943 by the Vichy Government, which had prohibited abortion as a crime against the State, because it diminished the number of potential soldiers."

This is their story, an untold chapter in the history of both the United States and Spain.

A young officer returns to his base after a daring mission. The cook's assistant, a religious Holocaust survivor, is envious of him. He believes that there is a place in heaven reserved for the brave officer who endangers his life for the sake of his Jewish brethren. The officer, in the spirit of the Zionist ethos, is secular and a non-believer. At the moment, he is so hungry that, for a plate of shakshuka, he is prepared to sign a contract transferring his secured place in heaven to the cook. Some forty years later, the present time of the movie, the tables have turned - the officer, now a retired general, is on his death bed in the hospital. His son who, to his father's horror, has found religion, is in a race against time. Before his father dies, he has to find that cook's assistant who, forty years earlier, bought his place in heaven. If and when he finds him, the son has to nullify the contract. If he doesn't, his father will go to hell.

"""This meditation on cinema's past from Decasia director Bill Morrison pieces together the bizarre true history of a long-lost collection of 533 nitrate film prints from the early 1900s. Located just south of the Arctic Circle, Dawson City was settled in 1896 and became the center of the Canadian Gold Rush that brough 100,000 prospectors to the area. It was also the final stop for a distribution chain that sent prints and newsreels to the Yukon. The films were seldom, if ever, returned. The now-famous Dawson City Collection was uncovered in 1978 when a bulldozer working its way through a parking lot dug up a horde of film cans. Morrison draws on these permafrost-protected, rare silent films and newsreels, pairing them with archival footage, interviews, historical photographs, and an enigmatic score by Sigur Ros collaborator and composer Alex Somers. Dawson City : Frozen Time depicts the unique history of this Canadian Gold Rush town by chronicling the life cycle of a singular film collection through its exile, burial, rediscovery, and salvation""--Container."
